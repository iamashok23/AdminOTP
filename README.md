# 🔐 OTP Generator with Email Delivery (Console-Based Project)

This is a **console-based Python project** that generates a One-Time Password (OTP) and delivers it via email using **Gmail SMTP**. It demonstrates the use of **modular programming** by organizing code into a mix of **built-in** and **user-defined functions**, making the project clean, reusable, and scalable.
